# IDEA:
To create a password generator consisting of options for user to input: password length, lowercase characters, uppercase character, numbers
and/or special characters. 
# COLLABORATORS:
I've gathered ideas from UC Berkeley cohorts on tackling the problem, breaking it down and writing proper code that would include all 
characters selected by user.
# METHOD:
I've created variables for all possible charactes and made if statements input a character from the variables created and looped it to 
generate a password.
